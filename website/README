Making pages is simple. We just add a file for every page. The file format is
that either:

- the page file contains PHP, specifically a PHP class with a handle() method
  which will be called. A sample class implementing this is PageBasic.
- the page file is assumed to be data for a PageBasic, in the following format:

[title with any markup in HTML, newline]
The content!

Edit the menu.conf file directly to alter the menu.
