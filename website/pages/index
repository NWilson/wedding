                <p>Children are most welcome at the marriage service, but there is also a crèche room with toys available if needed. Everyone is invited to join us for afternoon tea following the service.</p>
                <p>We hope there will be ample time to travel before the service at 2<span class="thinspace"></span>pm. <a href="http://www.eden-cambridge.org">Eden Baptist Church</a> is situated a few minutes’ walk from Cambridge city centre, and near the Grafton Centre, so there are plenty of places to have lunch beforehand, should you wish. A few suggestions would be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Michaelhouse Cafe, Trinity St — lovely converted church, serving home-cooked light and more substantial lunches (site of future mother-in-laws’ first meeting!)</li>
                    <li>Sticky Beaks, King St — highly recommended (though not personally experienced) cafe</li>
                    <li>La Margharita, Bridge St — independent Italian restaurant (backdrop for Nicholas and Elspeth’s first evening out together!)</li>
                    <li>Copper Kettle, Kings Parade — lovely views of Kings’ College</li>
                    <li>Rainbow Cafe, Kings Parade — vegetarian restaurant</li>
                    <li>The Cambridge Brew house — new gastropub, not far from Eden</li>
                    <li>There are also plenty of chain cafes in Cambridge city centre, and a variety of eateries on Burleigh St, round the corner from Eden.</li>
                </ul>
