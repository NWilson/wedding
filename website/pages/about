About us
<h2>About us</h2>

<p>We now both live and work in Cambridge. Nicholas is a software engineer with RealVNC, and Elspeth works for Eden Baptist Church. Next year she will be starting a PhD in Linguistics, so we will be staying in Cambridge for the next little while.</p>

<p>Although they were both students in Cambridge and at Eden at the same time, they met in September 2011 when Elspeth returned to Cambridge after a year Germany, and in February of this year, in a muddy field near Wimpole, Nicholas asked Elspeth to marry him.</p>
