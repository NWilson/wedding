<p>Cambridge is a historic city, unfortunately not designed for large numbers of vehicles and nowadays often congested, so arrival is therefore best made via bicycle, train or bus. Eden Baptist church is situated in the city centre. Its address is 1 Fitzroy St, CB1 1ER.</p>

<p>If you are coming to the service and afternoon tea, you may like to park in one of the <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/park-ride/">Park&amp;Ride carparks</a>, and take the bus in. The bus station is about a five minute walk from Eden across Christ’s Pieces, and buses run very regularly.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to park nearer Eden, perhaps if you are going on to the reception at Homerton, the closest car park is the <a href="http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/grafton-west-car-park">Grafton Centre’s West car park</a>. Please beware this may be rather busy on a Saturday, and is pay &amp; display, and therefore rather expensive! There is also parking at Park Street car park, and, further away, on street parking on the Backs and West Rd.</p>

<p>The train station is about a twenty minute walk from Eden, or you can get the citi 1 or citi 3 bus into the city centre.</p>

<p>At Homerton College, there should be ample parking for guests, but if there is not enough space, residential side roads can be used instead. Its address is Hills Rd, CB2 8PH. To get there with public transport take the citi 1 or citi 7 bus from the bus station at Drummer Street and get off outside Homerton on Hills Road. Taxis can also be found on a nearby rank on St Andrew’s Street.</p>
