Travel
<p>Cambridge is a historic city, unfortunately not designed for large numbers of vehicles and nowadays often congested, so arrival is therefore best made via bicycle, train or bus. Eden Baptist church is situated in the city centre. Its address is 1 Fitzroy St, CB1 1ER.</p>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
<p>If you are coming to the service and afternoon tea, you may like to park in one of the <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/around/park-ride/">Park&amp;Ride carparks</a>, and take the bus in. The bus station is about a five minute walk from Eden across Christ’s Pieces, and buses run very regularly.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to park nearer Eden, perhaps if you are going on to the reception at Homerton, the closest car park is the <a href="http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/grafton-west-car-park">Grafton Centre’s West car park</a>. Please beware this may be rather busy on a Saturday, and is pay &amp; display, and therefore rather expensive! There is also parking at Park Street car park, and, further away, on street parking on the Backs and West Rd.</p>

<p>The train station is about a twenty minute walk from Eden, or you can get the citi 1 or citi 3 bus into the city centre.</p>

<p>At Homerton College, there should be ample parking for guests, but if there is not enough space, residential side roads can be used instead. Its address is Hills Rd, CB2 8PH. To get there with public transport take the citi 1 or citi 7 bus from the bus station at Drummer Street and get off outside Homerton on Hills Road. Taxis can also be found on a nearby rank on St Andrew’s Street.</p>

   <h2>Lunch in Cambridge</h2>
                <p>We hope there will be ample time to travel before the service at 2<span class="thinspace"></span>pm. <a href="http://www.eden-cambridge.org">Eden Baptist Church</a> is situated a few minutes’ walk from Cambridge city centre, and near the Grafton Centre, so there are plenty of places to have lunch beforehand, should you wish. A few suggestions would be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Michaelhouse Cafe, Trinity St — lovely converted church, serving home-cooked light and more substantial lunches (site of future mother-in-laws’ first meeting!)</li>
                    <li>Sticky Beaks, King St — highly recommended (though not personally experienced) cafe</li>
                    <li>La Margharita, Bridge St — independent Italian restaurant (backdrop for Nicholas and Elspeth’s first evening out together!)</li>
                    <li>Copper Kettle, Kings Parade — lovely views of Kings’ College</li>
                    <li>Rainbow Cafe, Kings Parade — vegetarian restaurant</li>
                    <li>The Cambridge Brew house — new gastropub, not far from Eden</li>
                    <li>There are also plenty of chain cafes in Cambridge city centre, and a variety of eateries on Burleigh St, round the corner from Eden.</li>
                </ul>
